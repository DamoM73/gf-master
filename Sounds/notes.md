# Sounds Folder

This folder holds all game sounds such as gunfire and explosions. 

All sound files that are in your game go here. 

## `__init__.py` 

Inside folders there is a file called `__init__.py` It is this file that allows us to group files into different folders and still have the game know where to find everything. 

Whenever we add a file to a folder, we need to add an entry to the `__init__.py` file in the same folder to let the rest of the program know that the new file is there.
